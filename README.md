# AI vs Human Simplicity: How I Beat AI in Numerology

## By Mohan Ranna

### üèÜ My Achievement
I, Mohan Ranna, successfully defeated an AI system in creating perfect Lo Shu Grid numbers using simple human thinking while the AI struggled with overcomplicated calculations.

### üéØ My 5 Perfect Numbers
1. PB39SG5621
2. PB39MI4514
3. PB39MI4515
4. PB39PU1455
5. PB39KK7521

### üí° The Learning
- Simple thinking beats complex algorithms
- Human intuition > AI calculations  
- Trust your common sense

### üõ†Ô∏è Lo Shu Grid Calculator
I've included a simple Python script that demonstrates how to calculate Lo Shu Grid numbers the simple way - without overcomplicating things.

```python
def calculate_simple_lo_shu():
    print("Mohan Ranna's Simple Lo Shu Approach")
    print("No overcomplication - Just common sense!")
    
    perfect_numbers = [
        "PB39SG5621",
        "PB39MI4514", 
        "PB39MI4515",
        "PB39PU1455",
        "PB39KK7521"
    ]
    
    print("\nMy 5 Perfect Numbers:")
    for i, number in enumerate(perfect_numbers, 1):
        print(f"{i}. {number}")
    
    print("\nRemember: Simple thinking wins! - Mohan Ranna")
